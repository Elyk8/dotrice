#+TITLE: My Personal dotfiles


* INSTALLATION

You will need =git= and =stow= to be installed on your system.

Just copy paste the following command in the terminal to clone the repository.

#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/Elyk8/dotrice --recursive ~
#+end_src

Notice the =--recursive= option, which is required in this config as it contains many submodules, such as [[https://github.com/plexus/chemacs2	][Chemacs2]] and [[https://github.com/NTBBloodbath/cheovim][Cheovim]].

Then, run =stow= to symlink everything

#+begin_src bash
stow */ # Everything (the '/' ignores all other files)
#+end_src

or individual configurations, dependings on your needs

#+begin_src bash
stow zsh # Just my zsh config
#+end_src
